# DevSearch Collaboration Platform

### Introduction

DevSearch is a collaboration platform designed for software developers to find partners for open-source or freelance projects. It enables networking, team formation, and direct collaboration on diverse development tasks.

The platform includes:

-   User Profiles for showcasing skills and interests.

-   Project Listings for open-source/freelance work.

-   Direct Messaging (Inbox) for seamless communication.

-   Team Management to organize and manage contributors.

The primary objective is to create a dedicated niche for developers to connect, collaborate, and build impactful projects together.

-   Project Listings: Post projects with goals, requirements, and collaboration requests.

-   Search Functionality: Search developers or projects by tags, names, and skills.

-   Direct Messaging: Inbox for real-time communication.

-   Team Management: Manage collaborators and project teams.

-   REST API: Built with Django REST Framework for flexible integrations.

-   GraphQL API: Added with Graphene for fine-grained querying and mutations.

### ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

-   Backend: Django (Python)

-   API Layer: Django REST Framework (RESTful APIs) + Graphene-Django (GraphQL support)

-   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

-   Database: SQLite (development), MySQL (production)

-   Authentication: Djangoâ€™s built-in auth + DRF JWT (via rest_framework_simplejwt)

-   Task Queue: Celery with Redis broker (for async background jobs like sending notifications)

-   Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose (for reproducible environments)

-   Testing: Postman (API testing & documentation)

-   Deployment: Hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://freelancereddy.pythonanywhere.com/).

### Key Implementations

1.  GraphQL Integration

The project now includes GraphQL endpoints powered by Graphene-Django.

-   Benefits:

    -   Clients query only the data they need, reducing over-fetching.

    -   Supports both queries (fetch projects, profiles, tags, reviews) and mutations (voting on projects, adding reviews, etc.).

-   Example Query:

    ```         
      query {
          allProjects {
              id
              title
              tags {
              name
              }
          }
      }
    ```

-   Example Mutations:

    ```         
      mutation {
          voteProject(projectId: 1, value: "up") {
              project {
              title
              reviews {
                  value
              }
              }
          }
      }
    ```

Access Endpoint: /graphql/ with GraphiQL IDE enabled.

2.  Celery for Background Tasks

To improve scalability, Celery has been integrated with Redis as the message broker.

-   Use Cases in DevSearch:

    -   Sending async email notifications (e.g., when a collaborator joins a project).

    -   Handling scheduled jobs (e.g., cleanup tasks, reminders).

-   Benefits:

    -   Offloads time-consuming tasks from the main Django process.

    -   Keeps the user experience smooth by processing heavy jobs in the background.

-   Celery Setup:

    -   celery.py added in project root.

    -   Tasks can be defined in Django apps (tasks.py).

    -   Worker and Beat services run via Docker Compose.

3.  Docker & Docker Compose

The project is fully containerized for development and deployment.

-   Services Defined in docker-compose.yml:

    -   Web (Django app)

    -   Database (MySQL)

    -   Redis (broker for Celery)

    -   Celery Worker

    -   Celery Beat (scheduler)

-   Benefits:

-   Consistency across environments.

-   Easier onboarding: run with a single command.

-   Quick Start:

    docker-compose up --build
